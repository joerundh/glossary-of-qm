            <p className={"w-full"}>First off, this glossary is not extensive, in any sense whatever. It is a mix of claims about a set of concepts used in theoretical physics, even still after these hundred years. And being self-pressed for time limits the scope to some extend. Thus this glossary bares all the marks of a minimum viable product.</p>
            <p className={"w-full"}>In that sense, then, it works as it is supposed to. The only thing it could be said to lack is material, of which (it might as well be said officially) there still is plenty unused.</p>
            <p className={"w-full"}>Nevertheless, with the possible exception of some terminologies, everything here is at very leasy, with the proper effort, verifiably true.</p>
            <p className={"w-full"}>And I dare say that the subject matter is almost maddeningly interesting, and only more so when one has penetrated the mathematics of it. Because it is much more mathematics-dependent branch of physics than the classical, in that what can be expressed using mathematics, cannot always so easily be expressed in mere words.</p>
            <p className={"w-full"}>And everything is made more fun simply by being somewhat capable at it.</p>
