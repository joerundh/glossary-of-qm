Its discovery happened when Heisenberg imposed a multiplication rule involving the dynamical quantities of a quantum system for the sake of consistency in form. This multiplication rule was shortly after identified by Born as the multiplication rule of matrices, which then suggested that the quantities should be represented in the quantum theory by these. Eventually the most fruitful observation in this context was that two quantities "
