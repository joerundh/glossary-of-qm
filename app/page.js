      <p className={"w-full"}>Quantum mechanics grew out of the need for a new method of describing the behaviour of physical systems at smaller scales. The resulting theory was not merely a set of new equations, it required a completely different mathematical framework than that of classical physics. Rather than computing how a system will behave exactly, or how an object would move around in space, quantum mechanics finds only the possible outcomes that experiments will yield, and to that only the probabilities (relative frequencies) with which any given result will occur, when the same experiment is carried out multiple times.</p>
      <p className={"w-full"}>Whatever the limitations of that might be, quantum mechanics has nonetheless proven to be not just applicable and very correct, but also in many instances able to predict phenomena that would otherwise not be describable or even detectable.</p>
      <p className={"w-full"}>In this *small* glossary, some central and relatively basic concepts of quantum mechanics are described. They are rather abstract, in the sense that they are applied to a great many different cases, i.e. for a lot of different quantum systems. All the same, how to solve for a specific quantum system is still a hard task, even with the basic framework laid out. This page does not go into mentionable detail about how to do that. Some significant emphasis is put on mathematical expression, which the reader will simply have to bear with, as quantum mechanics simply *is* best understood (as far as that's possible) through its mathematical formulation.</p>
      <p className={"w-full"}>The &quot;meaning&quot; of quantum mechanics has always been hotly debated by those who are interested in the question. To those, the best reply is &quot;whatever you say&quot;. Engaging with quantum mechanics in a practical way is interesting enough for some.</p>
